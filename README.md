as we have missed the merge deadline we have to make 2 different submit.

The code is based on mateerport's mask rcnnï¼š[https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)

The main improvement comes from 
1. better roi align implementation which is modified from [tensorpack faster rcnn](https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/tree/master/examples/FasterRCNN)
2. strong image augmentation especially random scale crop
3. using clustering to select proper CV set 
4. divide large picture into small part during inference 
5. finetuning the trainging schedule and mask rcnn configuration
