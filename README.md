the result for publc LB is 0.458 at 240/3634
the result for private LB is 0.557 at 50/3634(epoch 64) and 0.498 at 180/3634(epoch 65) ,as we have missed the merge deadline we have to make 2 different submit.

The code is based on mateerport's mask rcnnï¼š[https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)

The main improvement comes from 
1* better roi align implementation which is modified from [tensorpack faster rcnn](https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/tree/master/examples/FasterRCNN)
2*  stronger image augmentation especially random scale crop
